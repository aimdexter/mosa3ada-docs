# Contribution Guidelines for Mosa3ada

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mosa3ada! Every contribution, big or small, is valuable for our mission to assist those affected by the recent earthquake in Morocco. Please read through these guidelines to ensure a smooth and effective collaboration process.

## Getting Started

### Familiarize Yourself with the Codebase & Design

Before making any contributions:

- Explore the codebase to understand its architecture and components.

- Familiarize yourself with our [V2 Design](https://www.figma.com/file/ryAPPQ4sA1s1dxoptitkTk/Mosa3ada-Project---V2?mode=dev) to align your contributions with our design principles and layouts.

### Development Environment

Mosa3ada is built with React and Next.js 13. Ensure you have a basic understanding of these technologies before diving in.

## Contribution Process

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Begin by forking the repository and then cloning your fork to your local machine.

2.  **Branching:** We follow the Git Flow branching strategy. Create a new branch based on the type of contribution you're making (e.g., `feature/new-login`, `fix/header-display`).

3.  **Coding Standards:** Our codebase uses Prettier for consistent formatting. Familiarize yourself with some of our existing code and maintain similar coding styles for consistency. If unsure, refer to a few existing files or ask on Discord.

4.  **Commit Messages:** Be clear and descriptive in your commit messages. Recommended formats include:

- Feature: Added new user login

- Fix: Corrected header display issue on mobile

5.  **Testing:** We currently don't use any dedicated testing frameworks. However, contributors are expected to manually test their code to ensure functionality and absence of bugs.

6.  **Documentation:** If introducing a new feature or a complex piece of logic, ensure your code is well-commented and understandable.

7.  **Pull Requests:** Once your changes are ready, create a pull request from your fork to the main repository. Ensure that your PR is detailed, explaining the purpose, changes made, and any other pertinent information.

## Communication
